    how to communicate enemy as vulnerable/ hurtful?
    how to communicate powerups?
    how to communicate enemy parts?
    what is the story / goal of the game?




ideas
    "orange" special enemies drop powerups
        => glowing nucleus!
    
    tentacles = hurtful
    
    everything "jelly looking" is "dashable" without taking damage
        => like Celeste?
        => plasma particles to indicate it's taking damage
    

    
enemies
    [x] goomba
    [x] dasher
    [x] shooter
    [ ] spiky
    [ ] giant enemy
